My name is Anthony and i'm currently a data scientist at the Walt Disney Company. I have both undergraduate and graduate degrees in economics from the University of South Florida. My main area is econometrics and statistics. I enjoy learning, traveling and of course....

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
