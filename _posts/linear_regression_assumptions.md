Linear regression is probably one of the most used statistical techniques in all of econometrics/data science. add stuff here...
Contrary to what many people think, there are a certain set of assumptions that must be satisfied in order to kind of believe you model. These are called the Gauss-Markov assumptions which is named after mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Andrey Markov.

  1. Linear in the parameters
  2. Random Sampling
  3. No *Perfect* collinearity
  4. Zero conditional mean; the expected value of u|x = 0
  5. Homoskedasticity
  
With it being one of the most used techniques, it's shocking to see how many people are misinformed on these assumptions. I wonder how many people are incorrectly using one of the most simplest techniques out there in the wild. I've read things on forums like [reddit](https://reddit.com/r/datascience) like you can only model a linear relationship (referring to the first assumption), how you cant have multicollinearity etc. I just wanted to quickly talk through the assumptions and their meanings...
